            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p style="color:blue; text-align:center;">Hi there! I'm Jo, a passionate web developer and tech enthusiast based in San Francisco. From a young age, I've been fascinated by the ever-evolving world of technology and its ability to shape our lives in remarkable ways.
                My journey into web development began during my college years when I discovered the power of coding and the endless possibilities it offered. What started as a curiosity quickly blossomed into a deep-rooted passion, and I haven't looked back since.
                Over the years, I've honed my skills in various programming languages and frameworks, constantly staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices. My expertise lies in creating responsive and user-friendly websites that not only look great but also deliver exceptional performance and functionality.
                Attention to detail and a commitment to delivering high-quality work are at the core of my approach. I take pride in crafting clean, well-documented code that is both efficient and scalable, ensuring a smooth and seamless experience for end-users.
                When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, indulging in my love for photography, or simply spending quality time with friends and family. I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, as it fuels my creativity and allows me to approach challenges with a fresh perspective.
                I'm always eager to take on new projects and collaborate with like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology and innovation. If you're looking for a dedicated web developer who can bring your ideas to life, let's connect and explore how we can work together.
                Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to the opportunity to create something extraordinary together!</p>
